Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history
Therе's a party downtown, near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gеttin' tipsy

I've been Boozey since I left, I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma', I ain't forget (Oh, Lord, uh)
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend (Oh, Lord)
